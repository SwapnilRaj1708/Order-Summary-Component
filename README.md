### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's youtube challenge](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - This helped me for my all CSS related problems. I really like his videos because he explain every property in detail and in depth and i would recommend his videos to others too.
- [Kevin Powell's website](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/) - This is an amazing website which also has free courses on HTML and CSS and I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
